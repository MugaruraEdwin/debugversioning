What is debugging?
Debugging is finding and solving errors in code.

What is a bug?

- A Bug a problem in software / hardware.
- Error in code that prevents us from achieving the desired result.
- Glitch that prevents a program from achieving the desired output.



 Why debug?

 - To solve quick problems
 - To achieve the desired result
 - To save resources i.e. time and money
 - Helps developers improve their levels of productivity i.e. efficiency
 
Types of Bugs

 - Syntax Errors
   Errors that occur when a computer program had incorrectly typed a statement i.e. doesn't follow the syntactical rules I.e mistyping, mispelling, incorrect use of variables, functions and statements.

 - Logic Errors
   Occurs when the steps taken to perform the task correctly are not well done e.g. infinite loop

 -Semantic Errors
  Occur due to the improper use of programming statements

 -Runtime Errors: Occurs when a program you are using crashes or produces wrong output ( happens after running a program)  i.e. division by zero, undefined values, adding a string to an integer, division by a null value.
  

 - Design Bugs: This is a bug that is comes in as a fault during the design carried from that to implementation. 

   OR
   
   Design bug is one caused by poor or inadequate design decisions e.g. designing bad user interfaces, wrong datatypes

How do we debug?

5Ps - Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance

Debugging Principles

- Bugs caught early, after you've made them are pretty easy to fix i.e. because details are fresh in your mind and you know exactly where to look.
- Once bugs escape they are very hard to find I.e. because you now have a larger code base to search from, it makes it hard to find since you have a lot on your mind, with many lines to read through.

The Debugging Cycle.( CTCD)

1. Coding: Point of writing code to accomplish a desired result.
2. Testing: Test if the code works (checking code functionality)/ achieves desired output.
3. If the code works as desired, then Continue coding.
4. If the code is not working, we then debug.
5. Recycle through the steps.

Difference between Debugging and Testing

Debugging is finding and solving errors in code while testing is what do we need to do break my code i.e. breaking your code for if incase scenarios. 

Steps for Debugging
1. Plan your attack
2. Backup your files ( can be interchanged with step1) i.e. using git to keep track of changes
3. Isolate the code(block) that could have the error .e commenting it out
4. Find the erroneous code(line(s)) i.e. the issue/glitch in the code
5. Fix the error, don't patch it.
6. Test the fix.
7. Look for similar bugs.
